# MAZE SOLVER
# Description
  This python script solves mazes - finds and marks shortest path from start to end of a maze using A* (A star) algorithm.
  I tested it for mazes up to size of 500x500.
# How to use it
  Simply launch main.py file in terminal by typing:
    ```python main.py```
  You can either chose to solve maze created by yourself - from .txt file or solve randomly generated maze which program generates. There is a baisc menu in which you can choose your preferences by typing in number coresponding to option.
