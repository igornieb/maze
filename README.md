# MAZE SOLVER
Maze solver made in python
<!-- TOC -->
# Description
  This python script solves mazes - finds and marks shortest path from start to end of a maze using A* (A star) algorithm.
  I tested it for mazes up to size of 150x150. For mazes bigger than 100x100 it takes considerable amount of time to execute. I didnâ€™t use any maze library because I wanted to try to implement everything on my own.
# How to use it
  You can either chose to solve maze created by yourself - from .txt file or solve randomly generated maze which program generates. There is a baisc menu in which you can choose your preferences by typing in number coresponding to option.
